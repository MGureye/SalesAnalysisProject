This project demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into clean, usable insights through a mix of programming, analytics, and visualization.

It began as a Java program focused on file input/output and data cleaning, but I expanded it into a portfolio-ready project that integrates with Power BI for visualization and includes UX concepts for future scalability.

Key Features

Data Cleaning in Java
- Filters invalid values (e.g., missing or NaN entries).
- Creates a cleaned CSV file ready for analysis.

Statistical Analysis
- Computes total sales, average sales, and top-selling product.
- Provides console-based summaries for quick insights.

Integration with Power BI

- Cleaned CSV is imported into Power BI.
- Built interactive dashboards showing sales by product, sales distribution, and trends.

Future UX Expansion
- Concept for a user-facing dashboard (could be web or mobile).



How to Run

Run the Java code
Compile: javac SalesTracker.java
Run: java SalesTracker
Input: sales.csv
Output: salescleaned.csv

Load into Power BI
- Open Power BI Desktop.
- Import salescleaned.csv.
- Create visuals (bar chart, cards, etc.).

(Optional) UX Mockups

Open the /images folder to see Figma mockups of how this project could evolve into a user-facing dashboard.

Console Output

--- Sales Summary ---
Total Sales: $1,236.25
Average Sale: $154.53
Top-Selling Product: Jeans

Reflection

This project shows how I can take a classroom-level coding assignment and evolve it into a portfolio-ready data project.

By combining:
- Programming (Java)
- Data Analytics (Power BI)
- UX Design (Figma)

I demonstrate the type of problem-solving, tool integration, and real-world thinking expected in data analyst, business analyst, and tech analyst internships.

It also reflects my interest in expanding beyond backend logic into data visualization and user experience, making the project relevant for both technical and consulting roles.
