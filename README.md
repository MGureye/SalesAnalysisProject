# Sales Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into clean, usable insights through programming and analytics.

It began as a Java program focused on file input/output and data cleaning, and I later expanded it with a Python notebook for additional data analysis. The project is designed to show how classroom assignments can be evolved into portfolio-ready, real-world style work.

## Key Features

### Data Cleaning in Java
- Filters invalid values (e.g., missing or `NaN` entries).
- Creates a cleaned CSV file ready for analysis.
- Console-based summary of total sales, average sales, and top-selling product.

### Analysis in Python
- Uses pandas for structured data handling.
- Produces a clean dataset and summary statistics.
- Generates basic visualizations (histograms of sales).

### Future Expansion
- Possible integration with Power BI or Tableau for richer dashboards.
- UX mockups for a manager-facing sales tracker tool (planned).

## How to Run

### Java Program
1. Compile:  
   ```bash
   javac SalesTracker.java
2. Run:
java SalesTracker
Input: sales.csv
Output: salescleaned.csv

Python Notebook
1. Open sales_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the cells to see:
- Cleaned dataset
- Summary stats
- Histogram visualization

Console Output Example
--- Sales Summary ---
Total Sales: $1,237.00
Average Sale: $154.63
Top-Selling Product: Jeans

Reflection

This project shows how I can take academic-level work and transform it into something closer to real-world analysis. By combining Java programming with Python data analytics, I demonstrate the ability to clean, analyze, and present data in multiple ways.

It also highlights my interest in expanding projects over time, adding visualization tools or UX design elements in the future to make them more useful for decision-making in business or technical settings.
